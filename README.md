# Metagrating Simulation

This is a forked code from 
[JonFan lab's Metagrating-Topology-Optimization](https://github.com/jonfanlab/Metagrating-Topology-Optimization)

Since the simulation is a great benchmark, I slightly modified the code to extract a one-step adjoint gradient and efficiency.
(In other words, one-step simulation is done, but no optimization is applied)
